------------------

New
~~~

- Add Travis commands to deploy to Pypi. [Rajat Venkatesh]

- Add Context to capture information when processing migrations. [Rajat
  Venkatesh]

  Migrations as well as upgrade/downgrade functions now take a context
  (a dict) to capture running information. Context is useful to pass
  state to revisions.
  A new test suite - test_integration has been added to test complete
  workflows. The first test generates a revision and runs it.

- Add upgrade and pending functions. [Rajat Venkatesh]

  A new member variable `current` keeps track of revision that has been run.
  `upgrade` function upgrades pending revisions
  `pending` returns a list of revisions that have not been run.

- Add Travis configuration file. [vrajat]

- Add test for generation of first commit. [Rajat Venkatesh]

  RevisionMap has been removed and assimilated into Migrations.
  Test does not check the contents of migration file.

- Add a unit test based on py.test. [Rajat Venkatesh]

  Code in migrations module is also cleaned up. The test checks
  that the module can be imported and it can handle an empty directory

- Support two APIs to list & generate migrations. [Rajat Venkatesh]

  Add two API calls to generate and list migrations. This commit
  has been pulled out from a parent project and still has some
  left over code.

Fix
~~~

- Fix test failures. [vrajat]

  Fix tests by using the latest py.test. Also change mako template file's extension to .py even
  though its not a valid python file so that pip and distutils will pick up the package.

- Initial commit. [vrajat]
